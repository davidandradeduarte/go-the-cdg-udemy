# Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)

Collection of notes and exercises took during the course.

## Course notes

* Go is not a fully OOP enabled language and doesn't have a class type.
* `main` is a reserved package name for runable programs
* variable declaration `var x string = "2"` or infered by the compiler `x := "2"`
* functions `func x(a int, b int) string {}` _(from what a saw until now, the type allways goes after the declaration)_
* foreach functionality `for i, item := range collection {}` which holds the index, which is a nice to have.
* The compiler will not build your program if you have declared variables that are not used in your code.
* Receiver functions are kind alike C# extensions methods. They extend functionality of a type, allowing access to the type's instance.
